30907,1858,overview,"On December 3, 2010, Hayden was diagnosed with leukemia. It was a complete shock and turned our world upside down, he's such a happy little boy.

Here's how we found out! We were taking him to his pediatrician for a consult, because he was having tremors in his hands. The morning of his appointment, he spiked a fever of 102.6... so when we got to his doc, she ran what virus test she could in her office, and it all came back negative. So she sent us to the hospital to have his blood drawn. We went back to her office and waited for the results. She finally got his white blood cell count after they closed, and it was normal. The doc called me at 9:00 that night with the rest of the results, and his red blood cell count and platelet count were both really low. She wanted us to come back to the office the next morning for more blood work and she would talk to the pathologist. When we got there, she came in the exam room after speaking with the pathologist, and told us that he has leukemia.

And now we're on the journey to recovery, because we ARE NOT going to give up!"

Kayne was immediately sent to Pitt Memorial Hospital and was diagnosed with Hepatoblastoma. We were given two choices: Take him home to spend the little time he had left or go to NC Children's Hospital for possible treatment. Of course, we were on our way to UNC within hours. I will NEVER forget those words. I will never forget how my heart was broken for my little boy, who had just endured so much in the NICU.

86057,3608,overview,On March 9th 2013 Haylee had fallen off the bed and hit her head. It was constant screaming that her head hurt so I thought something has to be wrong. We watched her for a few hours then she started puking so we had called 911 because we had thought she had a concussion. They then take her to the hospital and they start doing testing on her. Doctor wanted to do a CT scan to see if there was bleeding in her brain or if her skull was cracked or anything. They had given her medicine to stop her from vomiting. After hours of sitting in the Children’s ED they finally do a CT scan. We waited a few more hours. Then the Doctor comes in and says I really wish I had good news for you but I don’t. He said looking at the CT scan they see a Large mass in her brain that should not be there. He then says they are going to have life flight come and transport her to UCSF right away. I was there by myself scared and didn’t know what to think. I felt like I was in my worst nightmare of my life.

86059,3608,short_description,On March 9th 2013 Haylee had fallen off the bed and hit her head. It was constant screaming that her head hurt so I thought something has to be wrong. We watched her for a few hours then she started puking so we had called 911 because we had thought she had a concussion.

107615,4500,overview,"Chloe is a 2 year old little girl who was born with hemangioma underneath her right eyelid.  The hemangioma has grown into her sinus cavity causing her to not get the proper amount of oxygen required.

The iPad would help to keep her occupied during the plane rides to and from treatment as well as keep her entertained while in the hospital for long stays. I am currently living on unemployment and with medical bills and everyday living expenses, I just do not have the money to purchase one. I added an iPad to her Angels Sending Hope Wish List and was asked to remove it because it was to big of a request. I pray that your organization can help me."

3089,638,overview,"Madison was a healthy, playful, energetic and beautiful girl until June 2012 when cancer struck her. We were caught off guard and so was she, because she was not feeling sick or bad at all when we found out about her diagnoses. She used to love to dance, sing and play outside. Now she still likes to do all of it but does not have the energy most of the time. She knows that she has been diagnosed with leukemia but we don't say cancer around her. I don't think she knows what cancer is but we just don't like the sound of cancer. She at first thought the hospital made her sick because she felt good when she was admitted the first time, we had to explain it all to her now I think she gets it but knows by the grace of GOD she is healed and will get better.
<h3>Interests:</h3>
Madison loves crafts, games, and planting/picking flowers. She is a very smart little girl, she doesn't go to school yet but she loves to play school with her Nana (and anyone else that will play with her) She loves Disney Princess and the color PINK. her nick name is Princess Madison . Sorry I tried to upload a picture but I don't think it took"

He missed out on his kindergarten year at school, but is doing well in the first grade. He was able to finally start school the end of September 2012. In June he acquired a fungal infection which left him in the hospital with fevers of 104 degrees for 43 days. It's been a rough road, but he has only complained once!! He loves wrestling, football, basketball, and baseball! He was able to play Tball this past summer, some, at times he just couldn't do it, but he put his heart into and did all that he could. His daddy plays football on a Minor League team and Trey has become a kind of Mascot to them...they ""Play and Pray for Trey"" and wear orange on their uniforms for Leukemia Awareness, it always makes him smile when the guys give him a high five when he is able to make it to the games, sometimes it was just too hard on him to sit for so long.
<h3>Interests:</h3>
Trey loves playing video games on his dad's xbox, some of his favorites are Resident Evil, Modern Warfare, Wrestling, and Madden. He has an infectious smile, and the greatest gut busting GIGGLE you have ever heard, though we are just starting to get that back. He is our Super Hero for sure!"""

<p>Camron loves his 2 big sisters and his baby brother. He loves sports, skateboarding, and his scooter. Sometimes because of the weather or flu season or colds or sore bones he is limited to inside activities. That's why I think this is such an amazing thing you do! Given the opportunity this will be something AWESOME for him.<br />
Recently my husband lost his job and we are struggling. Camron's birthday is March 3rd and this would be THE BEST GIFT for him!</p>

She is helping her fellow patients suffering from childhood cancers and blood disorders at Children's Hospital of WI, by bringing them comfort gift items. She brings gift bags or gift baskets every other week. Her latest donation was 100 large Movie Night gift baskets. Next she is working on Make A Wish Backpacks. She has done so much for others and never asks for anything for herself. I would love for her to be able to get a gift just for her.

Jayson has fought a long valiant battle but the cancer has returned so quickly and to so many new places the only treatment options we have are ones that will provide a better quality of life and not an actual cure. He will be flying to Seattle for MIGB therapy in a few weeks to try a new therapy that will hopefully give us a little more time.

45036,2284,overview,"January 5th, 2012 was a day that changed our lives forever.  After bringing a seemingly healthy Jack in for routine blood work because we thought he might be anemic, our suspicions were confirmed in a way we never could have imagined.  Just hours after we had his blood drawn the doctor called and told us to leave immediately for the ER at OHSU. We were admitted to Doernbecher's Children's Hospital that night and stayed for a week. After a bone marrow aspiration the next day, we found out Jack has ALL Leukemia and we are in for 3 plus years of intensive chemotherapy treatments."

The surgery will be "" limb sparing"" which will replace the femur and knee with titanium.  He will continue with chemo this fall after surgery.  We are also researching lung surgeons that will need to remove the spots in his lungs.

Owen is a Dr Who fan, avid Geocacher, a multimedia guru, and is learning how to program computers. He also loves to sail boats on the Columbia River and ski Mt Hood in Oregon

We thought he had a hernia in which he did that's why we took him to the emergency room, with in a couple hours our lives were turned upside down. We were told he had a tumor that had taken over his entire abdomen the size was 15 cm by 16 cm and 10 cm in depth to his spine. When they removed the tumor in July they also removed 32 additional tumors. Dallas LOVES superhero's he tells everyone he is Captain America!!!! He truly is my superhero he has endured more in his little life then most adults. He has lost most of his hearing because of the chemotherapy we are currently waiting for his hearing aids. Dallas is so strong, smart, kind, funny and even though he is the one sick he always puts everyone before himself."

By Sunday Zeke had spiked another really high fever so we took him back to the ER and they confirmed that he still had an ear infection and gave us new antibiotics and sent us home. Monday comes around and Eric has started a week intensive class and I was home with Zeke and throughout the day he didn’t eat, drink, pee, or poop. So after talking to the attending doctor he told us to take him to the ER again for dehydration. So Eric got out of class around 4pm and I told him we had to go back to the hospital.

It had been 13 years since my diagnosis - and the cancer returned on my 3rd cranial nerve in September 2013. My family is devastated. And, I am just beginning this journey again. God guided me through this once, and I know He will be with me during this journey too!"

He began treatment in April 2013 and in June 2013 he had the tumor resected, the only way to resect was to remove a portion of his leg. The doctors performed a rare surgery called rotationplasty. On Dec 21, 2013 sean was declared cancer free. Today Sean gets around great with the use of a prosthesis. He is now 10 and has endured so much. He is our hero as well as a hero to many many people"

Brice was doing well and then started having TIA's or mini strokes. On October of 2013 Brice was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease. Brice underwent two major cerebral bypass surgeries in October and February to hopefully prevent him from having a major stroke.

125341,4998,overview,"On Friday, March 16, 2012 at about 4:30pm we received a phone call from our son's pediatrician with heart stopping news.  News that although was horrifying, was also somewhat expected.  Declan has pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Declan is an 8 year old boy who loves anything electronic especially tablets! His favorite game is Minecraft and he is quite the whiz! He would love to have an iPad of his own so he could play games at home and while receiving his chemotherapy. Thank you for considering this!!"

He is a fun loving little boy.  He came home with what he called ""headache"" but it was a nasty migraine that made him throw up and sleep. I knew right then and there that something was wrong but I was not sure what it was but mother's intuition told me something was wrong. I talked with my husband and asked what he had thought. So the next time we went in to see Kadyn's doctor I asked her about a CT or MRI of his head as I knew for being 3 years old he should not be having migraines. I never imagined he had a brain tumor."

He has not been able to swallow, scream or cry. Some improvement has occurred but he cannot communicate normally. They started emergency chemo but he has been in significant pain.

On September 25th, 2014 I had surgery to remove the large mass and I finished what I thought was my last chemo treatment on March 23rd 2015. Unfortunately, just a few short weeks after I thought that I had finished chemo and kicked this thing, it was discovered during my first follow up appointment that the mass had re-grown in the same spot on my leg and the cancer had also spread to my lungs. I’ve now cut back on all sugar and am eating all the right foods to help fight this stubborn cancer. I start a new treatment program on Friday, May 15 that will include another surgery on my leg as well as some radiation. I know that this time, I will beat this.

I never really thought about what my life would be like once I discovered I had this type of cancer. I lived what I thought to believe to be, one of the most normal lives a young teen would live. I hang with my friends, like to go shopping, enjoy listening to music, and love going to the movies with friends. Never did I think I would be including CANCER in my life.
I’ve decided that I’m not going to let this change my life for the worse and that my life is going to be changed for the better. I could let this cancer change who I am and pity myself, but I’m not going to because that isn't who I am. Who I am is someone who has gone through some rough things in my short life and have gotten"

259007,10087,overview,"Charlie was diagnosed with an optic glioma April 2014.. He was already blind in his left eye and had deficits in his right.. We started chemo but were forced to stop after 8 months due to a severe allergic reaction. During this time, his tumor began to grow again. We started another course of chemo and took a big hit on his labs. Charlie is learning braille and other life skills to prepare him for future vision loss. Charlie remains very positive and so brave! He is a role model to us all"

Although she's alive and beat most of the odds we are trying to pick up the pieces of the last year. She is very deserving of any and all the little spirit lifters along the way!"
