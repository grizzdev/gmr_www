				<p><b>No child should have to experience cancer.</b> And since we can’t effect the circumstances, we can effect the experience. And that’s why we’re here.</p>
				<p>An iPad is one of the most popular, most flexible items out there. Kids can play games, watch movies, listen to music, do homework, FaceTime with friends, and so much more!</p>
				<p>We’re reconnecting them to their world, a world that’s been turned upside-down from chemo, harsh treatments, and crummy days. We want kids to be kids, they deserve it, and this is one way of doing that.</p>
